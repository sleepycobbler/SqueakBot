CapnCantankerous,most of the stand alone movies are by various studios and different versions of the characters
acespangler,no but really I can't open it
sleepycobbler,"Ryan I see your arguement, so here is a paragraph from an article on data security and privacy talking about the sheer amount of resources / power it would require to do this:\n\nTo make it happen, Facebook would need to record everything your phone hears while it's on,Garcia-Martinez writes. This is functionally equivalent to an always-on phone call from you to Facebook. Your average voice-over-internet call takes something like 24 kbps one way, which amounts to about 3 kBs of data per second. Assume you've got your phone on half the day, that's about 130 MBs per day, per user. There are around 150 million daily active users in the US, so that's about 20 petabytes per day, just in the US. To put that in perspective, Facebook's entire data storage is 'only' about 300 petabytes, with a daily ingestion rate of about 600 terabytes"

CapnCantankerous,"Granted. But the thing is, facebook doesn\'t need to do it. Google assistant is always on. Even if you disable it and say, ""hey google"" it still reacts because it\'s always active. What if it\'s much simpler? What if google assistant is coded to react to keywords, stores that data, and then uploads it at random with other basic phone data? Like that one guy experimented on that reddit post where he measured outbound data while using instagram and Facebook."
r_sherm,groovy was a plagiarist

sleepycobbler,"You\'re not a little s. In my case as an adolescent I had a boyfriend, my mom wasn\'t a big girl. It was like, kind of, if I was gay, I wouldn\'t just be in this fing group, I wouldn\'t just be out as a woman. I would be talking about how that was real.\n\nI started to think that being a little s was okay for me, because like, I didn\'t want to be doing that to my body. I wanted to be out, but I\'d be like, ""hey, how do you feel?"" Maybe I was doing too much. I always felt that it was okay to act a little s, because I felt like I was trying to do things that I didn\'t want to do because they was good enough for me and I really thought that being gay was an evil thing. I was trying to be straight and that was also kind of a good thing to me and it just seemed to me that I kind of thought that it was okay that I\'d be doing it. And it wasn\'t. That I didn\'t want to be doing that. But yeah.\n\nIn the next couple of months, I read all of this. I read all of that. I read the articles on this site. I read a bunch of articles on it"
Ben Noises,im not rejoining
CapnCantankerous,"the only benefit is its a little more visual then paper and pen dnd, but otherwise worse in every way"
sleepycobbler,thishorsedoesnotexist.com

Ben Noises,where would you like to go
Ben Noises,"In January 2020, The Killer Bean Channel posted a picture on Youtube community confirming Killer Bean's return and will have a 10+ episode series. Although it has been delayed since late February."
CapnCantankerous,its a mess
Ben Noises,"i looked up ""floating city"" for inspiration for our minecraft house. idk"
CapnCantankerous,"o resign a game is to acknowledge that your opponent has reached a position so strong that only through gross mistakes would he/she lose. It is also a mark of respect because it assumes your opponent will not in fact make such mistakes.\n\nWhen is the right time to resign a game?\n\nTo my mind, resigning should be done as soon as the unwinnable position becomes apparent. Resigning a move or two before certain checkmate is actually a mark of disrespect, as it removes the opportunity for your opponent to make the killing blow"
r_sherm,Yeah... in hindsight its pretty cringe
sleepycobbler,of course any time
CapnCantankerous,and personally infinity war is my least favorite marvel movie
sleepycobbler,"In college I went to work for Psychology Associates International (which specializes in gender bias in relationships). They were a bunch of researchers who\'d done studies for me to get into gender bias. So I got into the group for a year of course knowing how to approach this issue. I got paid $200 a year for these classes, and the pay was $1000. I knew I was a pretty good mom and I just needed to work with him. So I went to their meetings, like the usual kind of meetings, and I got to know them. I don\'t know all the ways to go into gender bias, but I knew there was something I had to do. I was not a s. I was just about going for it and getting it out and putting whatever I wanted it out.\n\nYou\'re not a little s. In my case as an adolescent I had a boyfriend, my mom wasn\'t a big girl. It was like, kind of like, if I was gay and she was trying to break her pretty-boy-like personality and get on like ""wow, I\'m doing OK!"" I didn\'t want to be in those, you know?"
sleepycobbler,wasnt it though
Ben Noises,i already do that using the waves that come from my ass as it claps

sleepycobbler,"My grandmother took away all my nipples just to have enough body hair to fit into them. And now she\'s on top of me.\n\nOn the day of my first appointment with my dad and he told me that I really was a little sy.\n\nI had to stop being a mother. I was an a. I was a w. It was a good ending. I was just in a group with my mom and she wasn\'t letting me go. I was just plain sy.\n\nI was a child of God, an a w, and I\'m not an a if I\'m doing that to her. But I guess the truth is, I just didn\'t know how to find another way to find the little girl. The thing is, I could talk to a little girl and I would just say what I wanted, and then I\'d make her feel good so her little brain didn\'t have to ""hook up."" I was a s. I was the s. I was the s.\n\nThat\'s what made me ""girl"" to me: I didn\'t want to be more than a little s who didn\'t feel the same way I did before...that\'s all. I was the s."
Ben Noises,listening to two trucks with airpods sounds like a fever dream

sleepycobbler,"I was raised without dolls. My mom, I had a real-life-high on doll doll in every way but my own, my mom was only one of the dolls she could wear. I had the same dolls. I was in my noggin and my daughter had the same dolls but their all-overs were different. We were never all the same, though. My mom didn't know how to find a girl in such a situation, she had seen a lot of our little cousins, who actually preferred us to boys over girls. She didn't know how to find one but she really, really loved watching my cousins...and seeing all of them. She wanted to be a woman, and I wasn't letting her out of it, but I just like her...she's got a vagina. The boobs didn't touch."
CapnCantankerous,oh i see how it is

sleepycobbler,"Suck my d you chimp\nYour greenscreen makes you look like an apparition\n\nI was born and bred, but you've been called that. The first thing that makes you look, after all, is that you're an apparition. What a fing monster this guy is. He's a monster who should never have been a child, or a grown girl. He should never know how to look. What if he didn't know how to look? What if he wasn't a child and just wanted some daddy s."

sleepycobbler,"FE position .This change of angle to Polaris, as we move N or S , allows calculation by geometric method of the approximate distance to the star and its approximate height above the geographic N pole. No assumptions just scientific observation .\n\nIt is possible to determine the approximate shape of the earth through the use of precision scientific instruments , sextants , quadrants , zenith sectors and use of geometric surveying technique.\n\nSurvey along a meridian and the shape will reveal itself as distance between successive lines of latitude are measured, as will the approximate distance to the pole star - be it near or far.\n\nGeodesy is the applied mathematical method used to map plane geometric survey results onto a sphere .

AND HE TOOK THAT OPPORTUNITY TO PUNCH THE WEAKEST PART OF MY HEAD (THE MOUOTH) AS MANY TIMES AS HE COULD UNTIL HE GOT BORED AND LEFT.

Ben Noises,Bonk it
sleepycobbler,Good description of how we can measure lat and long in the northern part of the world.\n\nHowever you state the globe theory preconceived assumption that Polaris is at an extreme distance thus its light rays are basically parallel leading to the conclusion that any change in measured angle of elevation to the star is a product of the curvature of this globe .
CapnCantankerous,It's so painfully unfortunately real.
acespangler,how is this real????
CapnCantankerous,What's funny is I could see Bradly cooper playing this character too
Ferntella,My options are this

CapnCantankerous,"I'm just saying. (To conclude) The possibility exists. I understand that the data and power requirement to constantly monitor is unfeasible. However, despite that fact, they are still somehow doing it. Even if just slightly. There's an explanation for everything. Granted knowing wont make any differences. Because it's not like we can change it at this point."

CapnCantankerous,yolo
sleepycobbler,"Aight it's rant time\n\nI have spent all night attempting to turn my old phone into essentially a blank slate that I can do anything with. I had to 1. Root the Android phone. Easy, right?\n\nSo I Google and try to find a proper root software. Each and every one fails. I try kingoroot, I try oneclickroot, I try Dr fone, nothin.\n\nThen I start looking up my phone model, the LG G6 H872. Apparently, LG rooting is more difficult and not supported on all rooting software. BUT! I read about a bootloader called TWRP that allows you to root anything. \n\nSo I download the Android Debug Bridge (adb) and a program called fastboot, and I try to flash the ROM so I can have TWRP instead of the default Android boot manager. \n\nFunny thing!!!!! My version is the T-Mobile version, and the T-Mobile version doesn't support half of the goddamn commands I need to use for fastboot to flash the goddamn TWRP bootloader so I can use an entirely different program to root my phone.\n\nAfter hours of scouring the internet, I found a small glimpse of hope: MasterChief87. His profile looked like some Indian guy, and he hasn't posted on Android support forums for half a year. Yet his solution involved getting down into the nitty gritty of the 1s and 0s and forcing the phone to do what you want. He said he was close, but he hadn't figured it all out yet. \n\nI have yet to try his solution. I am tired, and need rest. But I have sent at least 2 messages and 3 tweets to Indian dudes who might have the answers. I can only pray they respond"
sleepycobbler,Richard pin that would ya
CapnCantankerous,ben its faster then taking a screenshot of all three of my screens at once and then opening paint and then cropping it and then saving it and then posting it

sleepycobbler,"Fortnight gamers, pog himself needs your help"
Ben Noises,"Raid has been praised for its graphics, but criticized for its microtransactions. Pocket Gamer welcoming the ""sheer graphic quality"", ""beautifully rendered and animated"" characters as well as a ""generous experience for new players"". However, the game\'s aggressive monetization has also garnered attention.[4][5] Gamezebo praised the game for trading ""the typical anime-style visuals for a more realistic, dark fantasy look"", going on to write about ""the truly stunning experience, with some of the finest attack animations and environmental effects weve seen in the genre so far."" However, the article also criticises the game\'s underlying monetization, pointing out that progress is difficult, ""particularly if you dont plan on spending any actual money on the various upgrades"".[6] In its review, BlueStacks also praised the visuals, saying, ""The animations are simply spectacular, with the quality the likes you seldom see in these games,"" and concluding that ""players that enjoy fantasy combat with a more realistic approachsimilar to Lord of the Ringswill likely have a very good time with Raid: Shadow Legends.""[1]"

IT WAS INSTANTLY CLEAR TO ME THAT I HAD BEEN FOOLED INTO PURCHASING A FUCKING CAVE MAN  'S CAR BUT THAT WAS NOT ABOUT TO STOP ME FROM GETTING TO MY VARIOUS DESTINATIONS IN THE DAY TO DAY. THE CAR ALSO PLAYED SOME HORRIBLE MEXICANO MUSIC THAT I NEVER FIGURED OUT HOW TO TURN OFF BECAUSE IT USED TO BE A TACO TRUCK BEFORE IT WAS USED TO TORMENT ABORTION ENJOYERS.

THEY COAXED ME DEEP INTO A WOODED AREA BY JABBING ME WITH A SPIKE EVEN THOUGH I WAS FINE TO JUST KEEP WALKING WITHOUT THE SPIKE. THEY TOOK OFF MY BLINDFOLD AND I SAW THE WORST CAR I COULD HAVE POSSIBLY IMAGINED. IT WAS ALL FUCKED UP. THERE WERE NO WINDOWS. IT SMELLED LIKE POISON. AND IT WAS COVERED IN PICTURES OF MUTILATED FETUSES BECAUSE IT WAS ONCE USED AT ABORTION PROTESTS OR SOMETHING. BUT OTHER THAN ALL OF THAT IT WAS PRETTY GOOD. THE DEALERS MADE ME SIGN SOME PAPERS AND CUT OFF ONE OF MY EARS AND I WAS GOOD TO GO.

CapnCantankerous,"excerpt from The Ancient Woods Mythology, by Leron Struss - ""at the edge of an ancient forest deep in the foggy mountains, miles from the lost settlement. a noble and his men stumbled upon what appeared to be ancient ruins of a long lost civilization, the buildings now overgrown and nearly unrecognizable as a city. At its center, leaning against a giant white tree, was a strange golem-like creature. Seemingly either dead or deactivated, the noble instructed his men to raid the city for valuables, and sent his messenger to his nearby settlement to notify his workers to begin. their task was to destroy the  local forest to make room for a large trade town that the noble had been instructed to build. upon entering the city itself however, a magical trap of sorts was activated, in turn waking the golem at the entrance. standing 10 feet tall, and his core glowing a sinister red, he looked down upon the nobles and his men with malice. the noble and his men lashed at it in defense, but for every strike they made, they found themselves losing ground. for every man that fell, the golem would raise them from the earth, as his own personal soldiers. eventually the noble and the last of his men retreated, and the golem and the city were never seen again."""

r_sherm,"I WAS ONLY ON THE ROAD FOR 10 SECONDS BEFORE GETTING HOLLERED AT. A VERY SMALL MAN WEARING NOTHING BUT DENIM OVERALLS WAS TRYING TO GET MY ATTENTION.  YOUR CAR SUCKS AND IM GOING TO KICK YOUR ASS UNTIL YOU GET A BETTER ONE. WELL NOW I GOTTA PULL OVER INTO THIS BOBS DISCOUNT FURNITURE PARKING LOT AND GET MY ASS KICKED BY THIS GUY. I GUESS. JUST THEN, IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I HAD PLANNED A ROMANTIC ARRANGEMENT IN THAT VERY SAME PARKING LOT. AT THE EXACT SAME TIME OF THE ASS KICKING.\nNOW, I KNOW THIS SOUNDS LIKE ONE OF THOSE FUN, CLASSIC PREMISES. LIKE A WACKY SITUATION YOU D SEE ON A SITCOM, OR SOME HAREBRAINED PG 13 COMEDY MOVIE. BUT EH ACTUAL EVENTS WERE VERY SAD. I TOLD THE MAN TO HURRY UP AND KICK MY ASS SO I COULD LOSE THE FIGHT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND GET TO MY DATE. I PROMISED NOT TO FIGHT BACK. AND HE TOOK THAT OPPORTUNITY TO PUNCH THE WEAKEST PART OF MY HEAD (THE MOUOTH) AS MANY TIMES AS HE COULD UNTIL HE GOT BORED AND LEFT. ALL MY TEETH WERE FUCKED AND I HAD A BIG AMOUNT OF BLOOD COMING OUT OF MY JOWLS.\nI SAW MY WIFE IN THE PARKING LOT AND SHE ASKED WHAT HAPPENED AND I SAID SHUT THE FUCK UP BUT THERE S NO WAY SHE COULD UNDERSTAND THE WORDS I WAS SAYING IN THAT STATE. I SLUMPED UP AGAINST A CURB AND LET HER ATTEMPT TO JACK OFF MY LIMP PENIS WHILE I LAYED THERE LIKE A SACK OF SHIT WITH MY GAPING MAW OOZING ALL OVER. THE NEXT DAY I EJECTED THAT DAMN CAR INTO A RESERVOIR."
CapnCantankerous,yeah
r_sherm,The rage was immense
GreedyGoblin,Shhh chat is kinda gay bro

CapnCantankerous,ive been mucked jerry i i i i its over for me now
r_sherm,I FUCKED MY CAR UP AFTER RUNNING OVER A MATTRESS ON PURPOSE SO IT WAS TIME TO GET A NEW CAR. I TRAVELLED 7 MILES BY FOOT TO THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP AND WALKED MY ASS UP TO THE COUNTER AND ASKED FOR THEIR BEST DEAL. THEY TOOK ONE LOOK AT ME AND MY UNTIED SHOES WITH THE BIG TOE STICKING OUT AND MY BUSTED ASS TOP HAT WITH A BIG RED PATCH STITCHED ONTO IT AND KNEW THAT I WAS FULL OF SHIT INSTANTLY. THAT I WAS NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AS A CUSTOMER. BUT IT SEEMED THT THEY WERE STILL WILLING TO HOOK ME UP. AND I TRUSTED THEM BECAUSE THEY GUYS WHO WORKE D THERE WERE ALL JOCKS LIKE I AM. AND IF YOURE A NERD THEN THATS JUST SOMETHING YOULL NEVER UNDERSTAND.\nTHEY BLINDFOLDED ME AND DROVE ME SOMEPLACE FOR 20 MINUTES. THEN TOLD ME TO GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE CAR. THEY COAXED ME DEEP INTO A WOODED AREA BY JABBING ME WITH A SPIKE EVEN THOUGH I WAS FINE TO JUST KEEP WALKING WITHOUT THE SPIKE. THEY TOOK OFF MY BLINDFOLD AND I SAW THE WORST CAR I COULD HAVE POSSIBLY IMAGINED. IT WAS ALL FUCKED UP. THERE WERE NO WINDOWS. IT SMELLED LIKE POISON. AND IT WAS COVERED IN PICTURES OF MUTILATED FETUSES BECAUSE IT WAS ONCE USED AT ABORTION PROTESTS OR SOMETHING. BUT OTHER THAN ALL OF THAT IT WAS PRETTY GOOD. THE DEALERS MADE ME SIGN SOME PAPERS AND CUT OFF ONE OF MY EARS AND I WAS GOOD TO GO.\nI THRUSTED MY FEET THROUGH THE FLOOR OF THE VEHICLE AND STARTED HER UP BY RUNNING MY LEGS LIKE FRED FLINTSTONE. IT WAS INSTANTLY CLEAR TO ME THAT I HAD BEEN FOOLED INTO PURCHASING A FUCKING CAVE MAN  'S CAR BUT THAT WAS NOT ABOUT TO STOP ME FROM GETTING TO MY VARIOUS DESTINATIONS IN THE DAY TO DAY. THE CAR ALSO PLAYED SOME HORRIBLE MEXICANO MUSIC THAT I NEVER FIGURED OUT HOW TO TURN OFF BECAUSE IT USED TO BE A TACO TRUCK BEFORE IT WAS USED TO TORMENT ABORTION ENJOYERS. WHICH EXPLAINED THE BIG VATS OF BOILING HOT OIL SPILLING ALL OVER THE PLACE AS I DROVE AROUND.

CapnCantankerous,oh hey guys its me bens of noises
CapnCantankerous,"The whole debate over 30 fps vs 60 fps is ludicrous. They\'re both fast speeds, you\'re comparing a ferrari vs lambourghini. A fun debate for some, sure, but frivolous in its nature.\n\nI, for one, choose to lock my framerate at 8 fps. It\'s truly the thinking man\'s framerate. Think about it logically. One may say that 60 fps is more ""responsive"", but riddle me this: In one second 60 frames will pass by, that leaves only 16 milliseconds each frame to make a decision. Far too fast for any reasonable human. Sure, maybe a professional e-sports player can make inputs every 16.6 milliseconds, but I sure can\'t.\n\nNow, at 8 fps, the frame gets updated every 125 milliseconds. Now that\'s plenty of time to analyze the frame that you\'re seeing, decide what your next move is, and make the input - by the time that happens you\'ll only have to wait a few milliseconds before seeing the effect of your actions. It\'s efficient. \n\nThink of an analogy of strategy games. For the sake of the argument let\'s use Civilization 6, lets say it takes you roughly 1 minute to think of a strategy for your turn and carry out the actions. That\'s 8 fps, nice, calm, cool, and collected. Plenty of time for thinking and action. Now what if we cranked it up to 30 fps or god forbid 60 fps. At 60 fps you would only have 7 seconds per turn! Completely preposterous. There is no way you could play a full round of Civilization 6 in only 7 seconds.\n\nThat is why 60 fps and 30 fps are absolutely foolish standards to strive for. It\'s literally impossible to process and react to 30 or 60 images every second. 8 is much, much more reasonable. 8 fps is the framerate of strategists, architects, engineers. 60 fps-ers just fly by the seat of their pants whereas 8 fps-ers carve their destiny from stone. 8 fps is TRULY, the thinking man\'s framerate."
CapnCantankerous,Lol
Ben Noises,there goes your anus bro. in da wind

CapnCantankerous,Not necessarily true. The roman empire and the kingdom of wessex had EXTENSIVE documentation. Granted much of it burned here and there with wars and raids but the royal family's kept pretty detailed records of everything.

CapnCantankerous,"Perhaps the only reason none of you notice this happening to yourselves is because you don\'t browse facebook as often as I do. I have a few meme pages that I look through so facebook is actually open a lot on my phone. My phone has an interesting feature where it alerts me if an app is using an odd amount of power. And randomly it will inform me that facebook, instagram, and imgur are ""draining the battery"""

r_sherm,"Ill ignore you calling me ignorant because I dont match your stance: or as you put it (ignoring the truth) which you also just claimed you lack the recourses to prove...\nLiterally no one in the world will disagree with the notion that google conducts unethical breaches of privacy, its something everyones sacrificed for convenience whether they like it or not.  Its okay to be paranoid of it and its an interesting discussion to be had, maybe they are sealing your data info, maybe theyre not, Im unsympathetic because you wont even consider the idea that you might be wrong and any jab at how conspiracy theory some of your claims sound has you doubling down with evidence.   It just sounds like you want us to agree with you."
