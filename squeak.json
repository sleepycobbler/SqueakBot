I had to 1. Root the Android phone. Easy, right?\n\nSo I Google and try to find a proper root software. Each and every one fails. I try kingoroot, I try oneclickroot, I try Dr fone, nothin.\n\nThen I start looking up my phone model, the LG G6 H872. Apparently, LG rooting is more difficult and not supported on all rooting software. BUT! I read about a bootloader called TWRP that allows you to root anything. \n\nSo I download the Android Debug Bridge (adb) and a program called fastboot, and I try to flash the ROM so I can have TWRP instead of the default Android boot manager. \n\nFunny thing!!!!! My version is the T-Mobile version, and the T-Mobile version doesn't support half of the goddamn commands I need to use for fastboot to flash the goddamn TWRP bootloader so I can use an entirely different program to root my phone.\n\nAfter hours of scouring the internet, I found a small glimpse of hope: MasterChief87. His profile looked like some Indian guy, and he hasn't posted on Android support forums for half a year. Yet his solution involved getting down into the nitty gritty of the 1s and 0s and forcing the phone to do what you want. He said he was close, but he hadn't figured it all out yet. \n\nI have yet to try his solution. I am tired, and need rest.

So I went to their meetings, like the usual kind of meetings, and I got to know them. I don't know all the ways to go into gender bias, but I knew there was something I had to do. I was not a s***. I was just about going for it and getting it out and putting whatever I wanted it out.\n\nYou're not a little s***. In my case as an adolescent I had a boyfriend, my mom wasn't a big girl.

But if I am going to be honest, if it was happening to me as often and as creepily as it happens to you, I would suspect some shit is up too\n", "Yeah your ads are weird lol\n", "But that's not a fair example because it's a big movie. It's advertisement sent to everyone\n", "Well we talked about king kong yesterday\n", "For me to conclude, let me give you my own anectodal evidence of what I see on facebook. Either they don't listen to me specifically, or I am awful at saying what I like\n", "I'm just saying. (To conclude) The possibility exists. I understand that the data and power requirement to constantly monitor is unfeasible. However, despite that fact, they are still somehow doing it. Even if just slightly. There's an explanation for everything. Granted knowing wont make any differences. Because it's not like we can change it at this point.\n", "Love wint\n", "But maybe because of that that's why things seem more targeted for me. Because it's ads are more direct to things I've recently done because I report literally everything all day\n", "its like that wint tweet\n", "amazing, an american hero\n", "Yeah. Youtube is particularly aggressive. I like to confuse it's algorithms though by reporting every single ad I see as inappropriate.\n", "like, watching a video on youtube, I could see that getting spread to everything ever\n", "And watched the gameplay video on youtube\n", "I talked about ghosts of tushtuna or whatever yesterday\n", "True. For example\n", "Taking all the other data, like location data and others, would be much easier and still pretty accurate\n", "Personally, my argument is that its just super inefficient to take recorded audio and convert it into targeted ads. Text to speech still has a ton of problems, and so why isnt there more ads for mistaken words? it just sounds like someone could say \"what are the names of shreks boys\" and then suddenly get a million ads for sex toys\n", "Youtube facebook ad.\n", "I mean. Look at this shit. We've been talking about facebook for 3 days\n", "But why not? If google assistance is already coded to listen even when disabled. How hard is it to have it convert a handful of keywords throughout the day. And upload them with the rest of googled crime data? I'm not saying always listening. But every now and then it just activates for a moment, records, concerts to text, stores it. And waits until it's daily upload\n", "thats the only bit though. there is a lot of shit they do that they totally do to invade privacy\n", "what I don't think is true is the microphone recording\n", "Granted this may be because it's a new feature on facebook.\n", "I definitley don't disagree that companies take the things you type, location data, demographic data, and other things to target ads at you, because thats totally true.\n", "Like here's a new one. For the last month or so I've started getting streamer ads because we've been talking about streaming a lot\n", "As a side note to answer a previous question. ALL of my ads are targeted. From youtube to facebook to even ifunny (which Ive long since deleted). Usually relating to something I've said, written, or related to things I search often.\n", "Once it's converted from speech to text it's a walk in the park for them to upload that once a day per person.\n", "But it's too coincidental. And knowing that google already tracks text data to do targeted ads. I really don't see the difference in talk to text data. In the end it is sent out as the same type of daya no?\n", "Because it was a coincidence! How many times have you talked about something and then ads didn't pop up? It's hard to notice something when it isn't there\n", "That is what they are design to do\n", "Why would I get 3 stove ads immediately after talking about stoves? Until this conversation I've never so much as typed the word stove\n", "Yes there is! Computers are damn good at guessing!\n", "Then how is it possible? There's no other explaination\n", "That's the thing, That shit is too easy to spot. There have been NUMEROUS studies (and if you want me to pull a college boi I'll get the PDFs for them) and they don't see any of that\n", "Because it usually takes a while day or two for the targeted ads to update\n", "I still feel like they can. See consider this, they don't upload it constantly. Somewhere on my phone it stored some simple data. A few keywords that are coded to be detected by Google search. Voice to text. We know they already track google searches to target ads right? So they store that data. And it intermittently gets upload as piggyback dats with something else that google uploads regularly\n", "I've heard of that\n", "Now something they can do is take screenshots of your phone\n", "Also completely impractical\n", "I know that there is targeted ads, there is no doubt about that. It's just that it's actually physically possible for them to get that from recorded conversation\n", "There is no rational reason as to why facebook gave me a hurdy gurdy ad.\n", "So I didn't google anything related. Also facebook does individual targeted ads. My siblings get different ads from me\n", "And this was before everyone else started playing and it was just me and jack\n", "The IP you share is the same\n", "No see that's the funny part. That ad is what got me to look into instruments\n", "And what if someone else in your house was googling hurdy gurdy?\n", "I mean, with the hurdy gurdy. You might not have seen you type hurdy gurdy, but could they see you Google \"sea of thrives connect two ships\"? Could they see you Google music questions? Computers can get what you need by looking at the things it does know and fill in the gaps\n", "There is no reasonable way for them to track it. And yet somehow they do\n", "True. Which is why it bothers me. It's not coincidence. If it were, we would see the same ads at the same time no?\n", "People monitor this shit, and there is nothing that pops up\n", "\"Some counter that argument by suggesting Facebook can simply scan audio for keywords coming into the microphone on a device. This means it wouldn\u2019t need to constantly stream an open audio channel from your microphone into the cloud. But Garcia-Martinez also pushes back on that idea suggesting not only does Facebook have millions of targeted ad keywords it would need to track, but the strain on your phone\u2019s CPU would be immediately noticeable. And again, nearly impossible to hide\"\n", "But it does it intermittently through out the day. It isn't constant.\n", "My phone also says apps use the background, they just do that.\n", "Oh, they address that too\n", "Perhaps the only reason none of you notice this happening to yourselves is because you don't browse facebook as often as I do. I have a few meme pages that I look through so facebook is actually open a lot on my phone. My phone has an interesting feature where it alerts me if an app is using an odd amount of power. And randomly it will inform me that facebook, instagram, and imgur are \"draining the battery\"\n", "Granted. But the thing is, facebook doesn't need to do it. Google assistant is always on. Even if you disable it and say, \"hey google\" it still reacts because it's always active. What if it's much simpler? What if google assistant is coded to react to keywords, stores that data, and then uploads it at random with other basic phone data? Like that one guy experimented on that reddit post where he measured outbound data while using instagram and Facebook.\n", "<@244666585334284290> I see your arguement, so here is a paragraph from an article on data security and privacy talking about the sheer amount of resources / power it would require to do this:\n\nTo make it happen, Facebook would need to record everything your phone hears while it's on,\u201d\u00a0Garcia-Martinez writes. \u201cThis is functionally equivalent to an always-on phone call from you to Facebook. Your average voice-over-internet call takes something like 24 kbps one way, which amounts to about 3 kBs of data per second. Assume you've got your phone on half the day, that's about 130 MBs per day, per user. There are around 150 million daily active users in the US, so that's about 20 petabytes per day, just in the US. To put that in perspective, Facebook's entire data storage is 'only' about 300 petabytes, with a daily ingestion rate of about 600 terabytes\n", "I'm gonna get on phasmaphobia VR edition\n", "Yeah yeah, the government's watching us, corporations run everything, china is our overlords, George Orwell 1984...\nSo, wanna watch me shit my pants?\n", "<@204016718488666112> <@253028272588193802> \n\n...

They're both fast speeds, you're comparing a ferrari vs lambourghini. A fun debate for some, sure, but frivolous in its nature.\n\nI, for one, choose to lock my framerate at 8 fps. It's truly the thinking man's framerate. Think about it logically. One may say that 60 fps is more \"responsive\", but riddle me this: In one second 60 frames will pass by, that leaves only 16 milliseconds each frame to make a decision. Far too fast for any reasonable human. Sure, maybe a professional e-sports player can make inputs every 16.6 milliseconds, but I sure can't.\n\nNow, at 8 fps, the frame gets updated every 125 milliseconds. Now that's plenty of time to analyze the frame that you're seeing, decide what your next move is, and make the input - by the time that happens you'll only have to wait a few milliseconds before seeing the effect of your actions. It's efficient. \n\nThink of an analogy of strategy games. For the sake of the argument let's use Civilization 6, lets say it takes you roughly 1 minute to think of a strategy for your turn and carry out the actions. That's 8 fps, nice, calm, cool, and collected. Plenty of time for thinking and action. Now what if we cranked it up to 30 fps or god forbid 60 fps. At 60 fps you would only have 7 seconds per turn! Completely preposterous. There is no way you could play a full round of Civilization 6 in only 7 seconds.\n\nThat is why 60 fps and 30 fps are absolutely foolish standards to strive for. It's literally impossible to process and react to 30 or 60 images every second. 8 is much, much more reasonable. 8 fps is the framerate of strategists, architects, engineers. 60 fps-ers just fly by the seat of their pants whereas 8 fps-ers carve their destiny from stone. 8 fps is TRULY, the thinking man's framerate.\n", "thank goodness, I was worried\n", "im in vc with the siblings\n", "@everyone where u at\n", "you coming back bro dude\n", "ricahrd what happened dude\n", "bro\n", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opbi7d42s8E&ab_channel=Miramax\n", "class thing project with a guy\n", "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-6fvPgmmmFRVsEvj92FYFaCFPF_dMBEP/view?usp=sharing\n", "im comin back one sec\n", "where everybody go\n", "wth\n", "https://youtu.be/3DAAKJEbVj4\n", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsXhk1xmYAI\n", "oop sorry ben, had dnd yesterday\n", "haha just kidding... unless?\n", "what if i..... just nuttucked in vc.....\n", "wait no come back\n", "clear\n", "wait no I'm finally back noooooo\n", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QFwo57WKwg\n", "https://steamcommunity.com/app/422970/discussions/0/2565312892658827203/\n", "oh come on\n", "where da hoes at\n", "https://youtu.be/z9eCyj1BKcw\n", "I cant hear or say anything I think\n", "or something\n", "my headset stopped working\n", "https://youtu.be/-zcOUnXd-HQ\n", "Mary Poppins > Nanny McFee > Movies > Zathura > Zathura > Zathura Any% Speedrun > Jimmy Neutron Jet Fusion > Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets > Chex Quest\n", "cant even watch Spongebob: revenge of the flying dutchman\n", "<@!253028272588193802> what a coward\n", "oop\n", "Please only refer to me by my real name\n", "I\u2019ll be there in 20\n", "You <@!204016718488666112>\n", "Who you callin jack\n", "Cut me some slack jack\n", "Sheit\n", "@everyone git in here\n", "Funny how it be like that\n", "Also something I've realized.

At its center, leaning against a giant white tree, was a strange golem-like creature. Seemingly either dead or deactivated, the noble instructed his men to raid the city for valuables, and sent his messenger to his nearby settlement to notify his workers to begin. their task was to destroy the  local forest to make room for a large trade town that the noble had been instructed to build. upon entering the city itself however, a magical trap of sorts was activated, in turn waking the golem at the entrance. standing 10 feet tall, and his core glowing a sinister red, he looked down upon the nobles and his men with malice. the noble and his men lashed at it in defense, but for every strike they made, they found themselves losing ground. for every man that fell, the golem would raise them from the earth, as his own personal soldiers. eventually the noble and the last of his men retreated, and the golem and the city were never seen again.\"\n", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltkeFYE1gSU&feature=emb_rel_pause&ab_channel=YMSHighlights\n", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weL-NjlIQ0E&ab_channel=Movieclips\n", "good timing lmao\n", "Do all of your side quests\n", "Enjoy it while you have it.\n", "Serious Handler\n", "Though I just got to the best part of the DLC\n", "It only gets harder too\n", "That sounds about right.
