Apparently that shed was full of lead and asbestos and I spread that  around the whole neighbourhood when I lit the place up. I was fired, of course. So much for passion, HUH GUYS? And not long after all this, the  traitors in my apartment block get me evicted because they think I deliberately encouraged a rat infestation by littering my apartment and the lobby with cheese crumbs and maggot-ridden garbage, just so I could go around killing them and smearing their innards on the doors of all the women I knew were in the building. TOTAL BULL. Yes, there was a rat infestation, and YES, I did charitably step in and apply my expertise as a former exterminator to help destroy them with the bricks I tied to my hands and boots. But I had NOTHING to do with bringing them there in the first place, and I have NO IDEA how those rat guts ended up on all those doors. There MAY have been some accidental crumb spilling, as I do like a good Lancashire, but it WASN'T MY FAULT!!\n\nI'm at a new place now, but I haven't seen any rats yet, so you can imagine my relief when I came across this game. FINALLY, someone makes a way to let me cleave and smash and burn rats with total impunity! It's genius! I can't believe I didn't hear of it sooner. YOU CAN CUT THE  IN HALF WITH A HALBERD.

I didn't really have anything else to do at the time, so I learned fast and always worked diligently, much to the approval of the higher ups. They said I had a rarely seen passion that would take me far in the job, but little did I know that was just another lie. It been a few months and we were out on a rat job in the suburbs. The little freaks were EVERYWHERE in this dusty old shed the old woman had in her backyard. Now, we had this whole procedure with poisons and chemical sprays and whatnot, but I had always though it wasn't enough. Like, it was too clinical, you know? Not hands on. You have to let the rats know how much you HATE them or they're just going to come back eventually. So I charged in there and started stomping and smashing and screaming, painting the walls of that scumhive with their squeaking little children.  THEIR CHILDREN especially. I hope rat females are smart enough to feel the kind of pain that only a mother can feel watching her children get slaughtered. Eventually, they start working together to climb up my legs and bite my tender parts, so I retreat to our van and get some sort of flammable spray. Then, combining that with my lighter, I go back in and just start torching the place. Oh you should have heard the screaming."""

I remember I got suspended from high school once, I was about 15, because I saw a rat climbing up a drain pipe and climbed the building after it just so I could kill the thing. I used brooms and sticks and things most of the time, but often it was just easier to get your hands around them and SQUEEZE. Ooh, I liked when I squeezed them. You know, not many people spoke to me in high school, not even the girls, which I thought was strange because I'd overheard them before talking about how GROSS rats were. I thought we'd get along, but it seems they were just  HYPOCRITES."""

One time I even managed to smack it across the room with my tennis racket, but it broke the mirror and dad made me walk barefoot across the shards as punishment. Two nights later, the  rat comes back with a FRIEND of his and they munch on my toes during the night. Now, dad had never even thought of breaking my ribs, so there was no way I could have bitten my toes myself. Thinking I now had some definitive proof, I show my parents and they just say it's what happens to all naughty boys - some pygmy Korean elf comes and gnaws on your toes as you sleep. Bear in mind I was ELEVEN at this point and had long grown out of all that NONSENSE. The weeks draw on like this until one day I manage to crush one of the rats with this weird pink baton thing my sister kept in her room (still don't know what that's about????) and the other rat runs away. I'm not sure if I killed the first rat or its friend and I didn't care because I'd KILLED one of the little  and it seemed to scare the other one off for good. For good measure, I took a bit of string and hung the corpse by the neck from my desk lamp, just to warn off any other RAT SCUM reckoning to come on my turf.

I was so furious I couldn't sleep, and it's a good a thing I didn't because it allowed me to catch the little bastard in the act - a RAT. Damnable vermin came scurrying from behind the curtains and began nibbling on the jumper cables my dad got for my birthday. I screamed and I stomped, and I threw my tennis racket at it, but it fled behind the bookshelf to safety. When my parents came to see what the ruckus was about, they wouldn't BELIEVE ME when I told them about the rat, thinking I was just a nuisance who didn't take care of his toys. My dad rattled my skull with a coconut until I stopped making noise, because he had to work in the morning, and the next day after school I started tearing my room apart looking for the rotten creature. It was NOWHERE to be found, but signs of it were everywhere - there wasn't a cable or book that hadn't been chewed upon with disgusting little gremlin teeth, and its droppings were strewn all behind the bookshelf and the curtains and IN MY BEDSHEETS. I was FURIOUS. Mum comes in and sees what I've done, all reason apparently deserting her. She won't listen to me, accuses ME of nibbling on everything like a rodent and collecting nuggets of  in my fingernails and scattering them around the room.

I had to 1. Root the Android phone. Easy, right?\n\nSo I Google and try to find a proper root software. Each and every one fails. I try kingoroot, I try oneclickroot, I try Dr fone, nothin.\n\nThen I start looking up my phone model, the LG G6 H872. Apparently, LG rooting is more difficult and not supported on all rooting software. BUT! I read about a bootloader called TWRP that allows you to root anything. \n\nSo I download the Android Debug Bridge (adb) and a program called fastboot, and I try to flash the ROM so I can have TWRP instead of the default Android boot manager. \n\nFunny thing!!!!! My version is the T-Mobile version, and the T-Mobile version doesn't support half of the goddamn commands I need to use for fastboot to flash the goddamn TWRP bootloader so I can use an entirely different program to root my phone.\n\nAfter hours of scouring the internet, I found a small glimpse of hope: MasterChief87. His profile looked like some Indian guy, and he hasn't posted on Android support forums for half a year. Yet his solution involved getting down into the nitty gritty of the 1s and 0s and forcing the phone to do what you want. He said he was close, but he hadn't figured it all out yet. \n\nI have yet to try his solution. I am tired, and need rest. But I have sent at least 2 messages and 3 tweets to Indian dudes who might have the answers. I can only pray they respond"""

This is functionally equivalent to an always-on phone call from you to Facebook. Your average voice-over-internet call takes something like 24 kbps one way, which amounts to about 3 kBs of data per second. Assume you've got your phone on half the day, that's about 130 MBs per day, per user. There are around 150 million daily active users in the US, so that's about 20 petabytes per day, just in the US. To put that in perspective, Facebook's entire data storage is 'only' about 300 petabytes, with a daily ingestion rate of about 600 terabytes"""

A fun debate for some, sure, but frivolous in its nature.\n\nI, for one, choose to lock my framerate at 8 fps. It\'s truly the thinking man\'s framerate. Think about it logically. One may say that 60 fps is more ""responsive"", but riddle me this: In one second 60 frames will pass by, that leaves only 16 milliseconds each frame to make a decision. Far too fast for any reasonable human. Sure, maybe a professional e-sports player can make inputs every 16.6 milliseconds, but I sure can\'t.\n\nNow, at 8 fps, the frame gets updated every 125 milliseconds. Now that\'s plenty of time to analyze the frame that you\'re seeing, decide what your next move is, and make the input - by the time that happens you\'ll only have to wait a few milliseconds before seeing the effect of your actions. It\'s efficient. \n\nThink of an analogy of strategy games. For the sake of the argument let\'s use Civilization 6, lets say it takes you roughly 1 minute to think of a strategy for your turn and carry out the actions. That\'s 8 fps, nice, calm, cool, and collected. Plenty of time for thinking and action. Now what if we cranked it up to 30 fps or god forbid 60 fps. At 60 fps you would only have 7 seconds per turn! Completely preposterous. There is no way you could play a full round of Civilization 6 in only 7 seconds.\n\nThat is why 60 fps and 30 fps are absolutely foolish standards to strive for. It\'s literally impossible to process and react to 30 or 60 images every second. 8 is much, much more reasonable. 8 fps is the framerate of strategists, architects, engineers. 60 fps-ers just fly by the seat of their pants whereas 8 fps-ers carve their destiny from stone. 8 fps is TRULY, the thinking man\'s framerate.'"

At its center, leaning against a giant white tree, was a strange golem-like creature. Seemingly either dead or deactivated, the noble instructed his men to raid the city for valuables, and sent his messenger to his nearby settlement to notify his workers to begin. their task was to destroy the  local forest to make room for a large trade town that the noble had been instructed to build. upon entering the city itself however, a magical trap of sorts was activated, in turn waking the golem at the entrance. standing 10 feet tall, and his core glowing a sinister red, he looked down upon the nobles and his men with malice. the noble and his men lashed at it in defense, but for every strike they made, they found themselves losing ground. for every man that fell, the golem would raise them from the earth, as his own personal soldiers. eventually the noble and the last of his men retreated, and the golem and the city were never seen again.""'"
